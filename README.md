# file-converter
A file converter made with AutoHotkey and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

## Installation

Since `ffmpeg.exe` is greater than 100 MB, it has to be uploaded to GitHub using [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com), and therefore has to be downloaded separately. To download it, simply click on the `ffmpeg.exe` file in the file tree, and then click `Download`. Finally, replace the placeholder file (called `ffmpeg.exe` but is only one kilobyte large) that was downloaded with the rest of the code with the file you just downloaded.

Alternatively, the `ffmpeg.exe` file can be downloaded directly from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org).
